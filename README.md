# SwiftOgg

This is basically [libogg](https://github.com/xiph/ogg), wrapped for Swift Package Manager, for your convenience.

The libogg C source code is referenced as a submodule of this repository, so that it will be somewhat easier to check out another version tag, branch or commit, which may be more relevant to use in the future.

# Usage

Add this repository as a dependency in your Xcode project. 
`import COgg` whenever you need to reference libogg's functionality.

# Supported platforms

All platforms that support usage of Swift and it's package manager should be supported. File an issue, if that isn't the case for you.
